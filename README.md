# UniTalkCA

This is a MERN stack based web-application designed to serve as a forum for university students in Canada to discuss about any-topics in one-stop. Users can select the university of their own choice and the category they are interested in to initiate the discussions. This was developed during a 24 hour nwPlus MLH hackathon starting from 21st to 22nd January 2023.

Technical Perspective & Plans

Our idea derived from spotting a market gap where there is no one-stop educational forum website for Canadian Universities. Coming from UK universities, I (Yan) relied very much on StudentRoom to seek out for information related to the UK universities, but here in Canada, Reddit seems to be the main source, but there is no forum based website to do the same as I did back in school. This was the driving factor in developing this application.

Our original idea included using APIs to gather information that might be needed for the users to have a look at, but due to a lack of APIs that can provide information about canadian universities, we opted to use static data. With an intent to provide information, we had a plan to gather information from the users' inputs, and find/calculate to generate results as needed (eg. calculating average tuition fees of a university by including a "tuition fees" field in every post discussed under a university), but the time constraints halted us from doing so.  

For most of us, this was the first hackathon, and the first time working with this techstack, so it was a great challenge to try something new.
